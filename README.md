# Make-a-Cube

Make-a-Cube is a website that will give you the ability to create a cube vizually instead of having to use CSS!

## What can it do?

With Make-a-Cube, you can create a square/cube visually instead of having to use CSS. It's still basically just CSS but with input boxes on a website to change the properties. Here is a list of some of the features/properties you can change and use: 
- **Color**
    - Modifies the background-color property of the cube. *For simpicity, this is a color input which therefore can not do more advanced backgrounds.*
- **Border Radius**
    - Modifies the border-radius property of the cube, since it's just CSS, rem and other units than pixels will work if you know how to use them.

## Usage

It's really easy, just changing the property of to something to whatever you want. It's  basically just CSS but vizually. For that reason things like rem and other things would work prefectly too, but for simpicity, the placeholder is just the most important parts.

## Planned Ideas

- **Adding cookies**
    - Add cookies to store the previously made cube for a day before deleting it. Helps with accidentally refreshing and also coming back a bit later.
- **More features**
    - Of course this would be on here, I simply just mean more customizability for the user.
- **Something?**
    - Idk. Maybe some day I'll add something.

## Background and Inspiration

One day, I was being *soo* productive watching YouTube Shorts and came across a Short by [@CodingLabYT](https://youtube.com/@CodingLabYT). The Short was about changing the style and border radius of a cube using JavaScript, which got me inspired to create a full website for creating more advanced CSS cubes visually. 

So with that, maybe an hour later I created this project. This has been the first real JavaScript project I've made, so I'm happy about how it turned out! 

I think my favorite part about making websites is probably the styling, so that's why I created this! I thought that I'd get to style the different elements as much as I really wanted to and also learn some basic JavaScript on the way. This may just be my favorite creation yet and I really hope you like it!
